<h2 id="conquest-colonization">conquest and colonization and its justifications throughout history</h2>
<p>We assume that since the beginning of time, humans have been living in groups with differing interests, structures and values. With different motives, such as gaining new resources, new land, or new subjects or protecting existing resources and group members, these groups of people have tried to conquer other groups and partly successfully done so.<br>
The act of conquering is one of forcing a group into submission, often by means of war.<br>
In addition to military aggression, political intrigue and moral value substitution were huge driving forces of conquest.<br>
Although first used in the Roman empire (“colonia”) to describe outposts built to secure conquered territory, the modern use of “colonialism” is most strongly connected to the European colonial period starting in the 15th century AD.<br>
Motivated by mercantilism, among others, meaning producing as much inside the country’s borders as possible, empires started to colonize new lands for agriculture, raw materials and goods.</p>
<p>The colonialist world is one of power structures. One of the colonizers and the colonized, often going hand in hand with the colonizers de-humanizing the colonized (calling the new people they encountered “savages” among others, also see: race-theory) so as to more easily be able to disregard their needs, values and ways of living.<br>
In the process of colonization since the 15th century, in the name of “progress”, “humanity” and “modernity” (s. Lily’s texts on modernity), a huge amount of distinct traditions, especially oral histories, ways of living from and with the land and indigenous power structures (s. Ili’s texts on matriarchy) have been lost.<br>
Even though this power structure did exist and made long-term resistance to it impossible, it is interesting to look at human history more globally and compare how different groups that were titled “minorities” adapted to these new circumstances. There is a call for a more nuanced view, rather than the allmighty colonizer vs. the colonized who were forced into submission, we should look at how the colonized groups adapted to and interacted with the new-comers and keep in mind, that colonizing forces had possibly been at play before contact with the written history tradition of western European culture and values.</p>
<p>The western European values often implemented by the colonizers and suppressing local systems of belief and value were very close to scientific, christian, economic, humanitarian and later modernist (s. Lily’s texts) values.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific:</strong> Yuval N. Harari claims in his book “Eine kurze Geschichte der Menschheit (2015)” that science was a huge factor in why western Europe was so effective at colonizing and why it gave the incentive to explore new places. It changed the narrative from that of many groups of people of “we know everything we need to know, and what we do not know, our gods do” to “we do not know everything and we need and want to find out”. This paradigm-shift led to blank spaces on maps calling for action to be filled, theories on biology and race to be made and led to a surge in ships going around the globe, financially backed by rich people, often monarchies, who were interested in not only gaining scientific understandings, but to claim the “newly
found” land for them and sending
soldiers and conquerors with the
scientists.</p>
<p>Christian: Since many scientists and
explorers, or their money-providers were
very religious, the interest to spread the
christian God around the globe and
being a missionary to the newly found
“savages”. This stems from a core belief
of Christians, that it is their duty to try
and bring as many people on the path
of their God, because only people
following that path will reach salvation.
All others are doomed to burn in hell.</p>
<p>Economic: The missions that brought
colonizers to new lands were very costly
most of the time and backers expected
economic profit out of the discoveries
made during their exhibitions.
Exceptions might be peoples fleeing
Europe to escape religious, ethnic or
other suppression (i.e. pilgrim settlers in
the United States).</p>
<p>Discoveries played quite a big role in
building the stock market and making it
popular, as people could pay money into
an expedition and possibly get huge
rewards out of it. This was also the point
where the power of colonialist Spain
and Portugal became less and the
British, French and Dutch colonizers
started to gain influence.
Enlightenment: The Enlightenment
period led to the ideal of church and
state being split and claimed to be
absolute. Interestingly, the
Enlightenment philosophers were very
intent on establishing equality of all
humans. This put the philosophers, who
were mostly rich white men, into a
difficult position, as they were mostly
rich because of the exploitation of their
colonies. Thanks to a lot of mental work,
some humans were deemed more
human than others. Those humans
encompassed white cis-gender men in
the end.</p>
<p>Especially interesting in the design
context is the emergence of “aesthetics&rsquo;'
in one of Immanuel Kant’s essays. He
states that only those who already have
every need met to be able to determine
whether something is aesthetic and
beautiful or not and art is supposed to
be only made for the sake of being art.
Much like the sentiment of only people
who are already full can judge if the
food is actually good.
With this (and humans only being white
men), Kant layed the important base for
indigenous culture, art and culture to be
valued less.</p>
<p>The Enlightenment led to new values
being imposed on the colonized,
idealizing a democratic, secular,
gendered (male dominated) and whitedominated
society.</p>
<p>In the following chapters, we will take a
look at various examples of conquest
and colonialism throughout history to
see where the differences and
similarities lie.

mercantilism : mercantilism is a
nationalist economic policy that is
designed to maximize the exports and
minimize the imports for an economy. It
seeks to maximize the accumulation of
resources within the country and use
those resources for one-sided trade. It
promotes imperialism, colonialism,
protectionism, currency manipulation,
and tariffs and subsidies on traded
goods to achieve that goal.
